- App has been tested on iPhone XR, iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 7
- I added animations on card reveals
- I play a sound on a match
- I decided to use storyboards since I was the only developer on this project and therefore are no merge conflict risks or difficult reviews to do of the storyboard
- If you want to run this app on a device, make sure to select a team, since by default no team is selected
